ReactiveUI Introduction Sessoin
==================

See Slides and Sample Code included in this repo.
How to use this sample.
Well you can ask me to deliver this session :P @arielbh.
But you can also follow the flow of the session by using the Tags I've created for every step of the demo.

I recommend you to use the BetterCode branch (it is almost the same as master, but with slightly better implementations of certain features).
than you should Git checkout Step1 -f and increase the Steps nummber to see the demo evloves around you.

"Step1": Shows simple data binding to ReactiveObject.
"Step2": Show how to implememnt RectiveCommand.
"Step3a": show how to implement ReactiveAsyncCommand. (Note: that it's Step3a and not Step3).
"Step4a": show how to get and use the Repositories with ReactiveCollection.
"Step5a": show how to use the MemoizingMRUCache.

Enjoy and let me know of any questions, problems. etc.
